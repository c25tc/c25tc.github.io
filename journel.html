            <p>This week I focused alot on my game. I actually started it this weekend and then worked on
                it during my spare time. I created a new pygame project in pycharm without really knowing 
                what I wanted to make. I just knew that I wanted to create a game. I decided to start
                by making a simple platformer game using a tile system. I created all of the pixle art and
                then transported them into their folders. Then I made a level creater so that it would be
                easier to make. By then I had a very rouph idea of what I wanted the game to be. I wanted
                to create a game that the player tries to last as long as they can while avoiding enemies.
                I also wanted there to be powerups that you can collect like a higher jump or faster speed.
                I then came up with a very interesting idea. I decided to try to create an infinint world.
                I had to make it so that the world only generated around the player so that the game would not
                glich immidiatly. I also had to make it so that the level looked somewhat okay, I could not
                just place random blocks. I finally decided on trying to use a chunk system. I created 4 chunks
                that were 16x16 and made a list that I could append different chunks to. It was very difficult
                but I finally got it working. I then realized that the game didn't even look that good and 
                I would rather maps that work kind of good and that would have ample places for the player 
                to go and move around freely. I scrapped the infinintly generating world even though it was
                pretty cool and went back to hand making a map. After this I started creating an enemy that 
                could follow you around. I still have to make it attack you and powerups and alot of other 
                stuff but it is a good start.

                This week I worked on making my website. I want it to kind of look like an e-commerce 
                website. My idea is that it you click on a project there are different images you can 
                scroll through and it also shows all of the journels that are about that project. For
                example this journel entry will also appear in the on the project page for this website.
                In the future I also want to add a sorting feature by tags on the top.

            <p>
                I started creating my present for my grandma. My family and I have alot of pictures with her
                in different parts of the country and also Canada. I wanted to showcase all of these pictures in a fun way
                so I decided to create a picture map where you can click on different areas to see pictures taken 
                in that area. I decided that I didn't want it to be different web pages to I created some java script
                to keep control of when different items should be on the page. So far I have all of the pictures on the east 
                coast but i still have to put and organize the pictures for Canada.

            <h1>10/24</h1>
            <h4 id="hashtag">#website</h4>
            <p>
                This is just a small change but I changed the theme of the website. I also found css variables so I can keep
                the colors constant and easier to change.

                I finally finished it! I gave it to my grandma for her birthday and she loved it. Looking back on the code
                there was so much that I could have done better. For starters I could have wrote out a lot of things in for
                loops instead of writting it all out. I also re-wrote alot of my css where I could have written it all under
                one class. Over all though I am pretty proud of what I accomplished and I am glad I finished it in time to
                give to her.

            <p>
                I started the making of my website. I first made a mockup on figma and got the color sceme figured out. I then thought about what
                would make the website unique. I looked at a bunch of NFT websites that I liked and got an idea of what I need. I decideded that it would 
                be interesting if I could make shoes flying around the screen as you scroll at different speeds to give a paralax effect. I figured out
                the best way to do the effect was to use the 3d effects already built into css.

            <h4 id="hashtag">#nft</h4>
            <p>
                I made it responsive. It was alot of work to make it work for all screen sizes but I finally finished. I had to make a bunch
                of different media queries for all screen sizes and had to face a bunch of challenges but it finally worked out. another effect
                that I found pretty cool is the glass effect behind all of the text. also if you click on the main shoe in the middle it switches
                the shoe and gives you all of the details about that shoe.

            <h4 id="hashtag">#quiz-game</h4>
            <p>
                I wanted to try and make a quiz game were depending on what you answered, it commented on your preformence.
                It was a really interesting idea where I ended up making a anger variable and a streak variable and based on 
                those, it gave you a different responce after every guess. It was a very interesting learing experence because I 
                made it all on one page so it does not link to any new page but completly changes the page through javascript. 

                I wanted to create a game that has a "robot" that responds to your answers. If you get the question wrong it
                will say something different than if you get the question right. I also wanted it to be easy to switch between games,
                keep it all on 1 html page (use javascript to change what is on the page so I can add animations) and switch the robot. 
                I did this by creating a lot of arrays that would hold all of the answers, questions, voice lines ect. for the answers and 
                questions it looked something like this:
                var entertainment = [
  [
    "who is the girl in the beatles song Get Back?",
    "Jane",
    "Loretta",
    "Jude",
    "Madonna",
    2,
  ],
  [
    "what is the name of Michael Jackson's famous sister?",
    "Jen",
    "Laurie",
    "Janet",
    "Karen",
    3,
  ], 
                for the voice lines it looked something like:
                var happy = [
  [
    "Hey! Way to go! Keep it up!!!",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "okay... misclick? Really focus this time...",
  ],
  [
    "Off to a great start! ready for more???",
    "okay that is more like it i knew you had it in you",
    "",
    "",
    "oops...everyone makes mistakes",
    "don't worry! you can still turn it around :)",
  ],
                I had those empty strings in the middle becaused it is physically imposablet to get to those sanarios with the
                way I produced the voice lines. The way i did it was the code kept track of two things, the number of question the person
                has gotton correct and incorrect and what the person got on the last question. I made a variable that starts at 0
                and if the person gets a question correct it adds one and vise versa. If the variable is bellow 0 and they got the question wrong
                that makes it different than if the are bellow 0 and got the previous question right. That is why there are six voice lines for each 
                question.

                I wanted to create a website for my nft so that people could interact with it. I found this sdk called moralis 
                that is exactly what I need. I have not done much yet but I have high hopes for whats to come.

                I made this as just an interesting project. It was a pretty quick and short project using p5js. I saw people creating 
                images with only symbols representing the different lightness of each pixle and it amazed me so I wanted to try it out.
                i used p5js because it is really simple to use the webcam and output things onto the screen.

                I had an interest in 3d over the weekend so I decided to look into 3d web developement. I learned about Web Gl and then
                realized that three js is a very simple way to use that technology. I then put together this quick sample to learn
                about it. I found it extremely fun and simple and I will definitely use it in the future.

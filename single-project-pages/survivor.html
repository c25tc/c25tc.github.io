            <p>This week I focused alot on my game. I actually started it this weekend and then worked on
                it during my spare time. I created a new pygame project in pycharm without really knowing 
                what I wanted to make. I just knew that I wanted to create a game. I decided to start
                by making a simple platformer game using a tile system. I created all of the pixle art and
                then transported them into their folders. Then I made a level creater so that it would be
                easier to make. By then I had a very rouph idea of what I wanted the game to be. I wanted
                to create a game that the player tries to last as long as they can while avoiding enemies.
                I also wanted there to be powerups that you can collect like a higher jump or faster speed.
                I then came up with a very interesting idea. I decided to try to create an infinint world.
                I had to make it so that the world only generated around the player so that the game would not
                glich immidiatly. I also had to make it so that the level looked somewhat okay, I could not
                just place random blocks. I finally decided on trying to use a chunk system. I created 4 chunks
                that were 16x16 and made a list that I could append different chunks to. It was very difficult
                but I finally got it working. I then realized that the game didn't even look that good and 
                I would rather maps that work kind of good and that would have ample places for the player 
                to go and move around freely. I scrapped the infinintly generating world even though it was
                pretty cool and went back to hand making a map. After this I started creating an enemy that 
                could follow you around. I still have to make it attack you and powerups and alot of other 
                stuff but it is a good start.
